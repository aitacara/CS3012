# LowestCommonAncestor
DONE- chose unit testing framework for python (unittest is standard and included in base python)   
DONE- create core functionality tests   
DONE- create dummy data   
DONE- create basic solution  
DONE- research and write tests for edge cases we didn't consider  

# LCA for DAG
DONE- change node class to enable creation of DAGs or create new node class  
*decided on using networkx to represnt DAGs   
*this also allows us visualise the graph easily    
*needs to be pip installed to be able to run the tests     
*Matplotlib also required    

DONE- create a DAG for testing in our test class  
DONE- create an empty method for our new LCA method  
DONE- write some tests for new DAG and lca method  
DONE- research solutions to the problem and change node class if required  
DONE- implement new method  
DONE- check edge cases. New tests.    
*case where no decendant i.e. terminal node     
* Build graph where there are more than one solution. Test it
